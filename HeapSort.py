# QuickSort처럼 in-place 알고리즘으로 또다른 메모리가 필요없다.
# root가 가장 큰 값이면 max heap tree
# parent node의 값이 child node 값 이상이다.
# min heap tree는 이와 반대이다.

#  Title: Heapsort
#
#  Statement:
#  Given a disordered list of integers (or any other items),
#  rearrange the integers in natural order.
#
#  Sample Input: [8,5,3,1,9,6,0,7,4,2,5]
#  Sample Output: [0,1,2,3,4,5,5,6,7,8,9]
#
#  Time Complexity of Solution:
#  Best O(nlog(n)); Average O(nlog(n)); Worst O(nlog(n)).
#
#  Approach:
#  Heap sort happens in two phases. In the first phase, the array
#  is transformed into a heap. A heap is a binary tree where
#  1) each node is greater than each of its children
#  2) the tree is perfectly balanced
#  3) all leaves are in the leftmost position available.
#  In phase two the heap is continuously reduced to a sorted array:
#  1) while the heap is not empty
#  - remove the top of the head into an array
#  - fix the heap.
#  Heap sort was invented by John Williams not by B. R. Heap.
#
#  MoveDown:
#  The movedown method checks and verifies that the structure is a heap.
#
#  Technical Details:
#  A heap is based on an array just as a hashmap is based on an
#  array. For a heap, the children of an element n are at index
#  2n+1 for the left child and 2n+2 for the right child.
#
#  The movedown function checks that an element is greater than its
#  children. If not the values of element and child are swapped. The
#  function continues to check and swap until the element is at a
#  position where it is greater than its children.
